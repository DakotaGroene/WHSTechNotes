i beleve the new i phone law dosent make a lot of sense. i have ben finding it hard to adjust to this along as lots of other people,i also see it being benafitian to sum people, like the teachers at school and the other staff..but i also dont think its the safest becuse,what if somthing where to happen at thr school building like,a school shooting,a fire, ect you dont have your phone to call for help or to call your parents,you just dont get that option and it dosent seem the safest to me ans the fact that either way there still going to have to fight with the students in order for the phones to be away. and thats my opinion.
