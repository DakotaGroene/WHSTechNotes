i beleve the new i phone law dosent make a lot of sense. i have ben finding it hard to adjust to this along as lots of other people,i also see it being benafitian to sum people, like the teachers at school and the other staff..but i also dont think its the safest becuse,what if somthing where to happen at thr school building like,a school shooting,a fire, ect you dont have your phone to call for help or to call your parents,you just dont get that option and it dosent seem the safest to me ans the fact that either way there still going to have to fight with the students in order for the phones to be away. and thats my opinion.

i dont really have a careere that im intrested in, but i think like gardening would be cool like selling cops and difrent fruite that ive grown on my own.i also thinnk that owning a flower shop and selling all difrent typs of flowers and bowkets would be really fun and calming. 1 way that i think computer science would/could help me with these profetions is by helping me figure out how much to sell my crops or flowers for,the seconed reason i think it could help is because i would be able to post my busnes online and get it out there to the people more and better. the last reason that i think it culd help me is because u could use it to charge cards and to keep all my work stuff oganised. and that why i think computer science could help me in my profetion.

i think that working in a virtual store for real money might not be the best idea for future jobs because yes working from a game would be cool and way more convenient for lots off people but i just dont think it would benifite the futre world for reasons like people becoming more lazy
